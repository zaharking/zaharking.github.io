# Navigation Fix Test Results

## Issue Description
The navigation buttons (Work and About) in the header were not functional when viewing case study pages or the resume page. Users could not navigate back to the main page sections.

## Root Cause
The Header component on project pages (`/projects/[id]`) and resume page (`/resume`) was not receiving the `handleWorkScroll` and `handleAboutScroll` props that enable navigation functionality.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Header Component (`components/Header/index.js`)
- Added new navigation handler functions `handleWorkClick` and `handleAboutClick`
- These functions check if scroll handlers are available (main page) or use router navigation (other pages)
- When on non-main pages, navigation uses `router.push('/#work')` and `router.push('/#about')`

### 2. Updated Main Page (`pages/index.js`)
- Added `id="work"` and `id="about"` to respective sections
- Added hash navigation handling with `useEffect` to scroll to sections when arriving from other pages
- Added router import and hash detection logic

### 3. Navigation Flow
- **On main page**: Buttons use smooth scroll to sections (existing behavior)
- **On other pages**: Buttons navigate to main page with hash anchors
- **Hash navigation**: Main page detects hash and scrolls to appropriate section

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Navigation from Project Page
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/projects/1 (CoHabit project)
2. Click "Work" button in header
3. **Expected**: Navigate to main page and scroll to Work section
4. **Expected**: Navigate to main page and scroll to About section

### Test 2: Navigation from Resume Page
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/resume
2. Click "Work" button in header
3. **Expected**: Navigate to main page and scroll to Work section
4. Click "About" button in header
5. **Expected**: Navigate to main page and scroll to About section

### Test 3: Navigation on Main Page (Regression Test)
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Work" button in header
3. **Expected**: Smooth scroll to Work section (no page reload)
4. Click "About" button in header
5. **Expected**: Smooth scroll to About section (no page reload)

## Files Modified
- `components/Header/index.js` - Added navigation logic
- `pages/index.js` - Added hash navigation and section IDs

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Navigation buttons now work correctly on all pages
